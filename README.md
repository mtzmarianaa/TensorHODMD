# Tensor DMD

This code performs experiments on tensor DMD and streamable tensor DMD. Given different settings for
the eikonal equation, we form a tensor. In order to study the dynamics we apply DMD, EDMD, QRDMD,
tensor DMD (tDMD), and streamable tensor DMD (sTDMD). Plot regarding run times and errors are generated.
Plots regarding the DMD modes for the different methods can also be generated.

## Instructions

Clone this repository. Once in the repository's folder got to the tests folder and then download
the necessary files from
